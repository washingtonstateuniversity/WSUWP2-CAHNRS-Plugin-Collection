A calendar system with many views, upcoming events widget, color-coded
categories, recurrence, and import/export of facebook events and .ics
feeds.

== Description ==

Welcome to the [All-in-One Event Calendar Plugin](http://time.ly/),
from [Timely](http://time.ly/). The All-in-One Event Calendar is a
beautiful way to list your events in WordPress and easily share them
with the rest of the world.

Our calendar system combines a clean visual design, solid
architectural patterns and a powerful set of features to create the
most advanced calendar system available for WordPress. 

Download the free Core edition at [time.ly](http://time.ly/) and
choose from 3 custom designed themes for your Calendar, or develop
your own! Additionally, you can install add-ons that give you
Posterboard view, Facebook integration, inline Calendar Theme editing
and more.

= New in version 2.0 =

* Made plugin modular, allowing users to install extensions for
required features.
* Improved performance by delaying resources initialization until
needed. 
* Implemented new theme layer using Twig
(http://twig.sensiolabs.org/), which will allow the Calendar to render
new views in JavaScript.
* Created time manipulation layer, which will allow editing of
event's timezone, and also leverage system ability to track timezone
definition changes when processing, or rendering of time entity comes
into action.
* Timezone information is stored with the event during event creation
and/or import ensuring event is treated with respect to it's original
timezone.
* Implemented soft-deactivation feature to help prevent fatal errors
which notifies user if an error occurs and makes plugin behave as if
it was deactivated.
* Allowing smooth interoperability with 3rd party cache plugins
primarily by not providing another cache layer which would cripple
behaviour of former ones.
* Added thin compatibility layer which supports up-to date
PHP/WordPress versions and provides support for older releases.
* Created calendar feeds extension layer, which is meant to allow
adding new types of feeds in addition to already existing ICS.
* Created configuration abstraction layer, which is safe to use with
3rd party caching plugins.
* Fixed repeated cron additions, which was causing intensive database
writes in some configurations.
* Extended meta-data management layer to save from unnecessary calls
to underlying database.
* Implemented robust and extensible filtering layer allowing to create
new filter types on demand.
* Improved internationalization support with respect to WordPress and
3rd party plugins behaviour.
* Updated to Bootstrap 3 for better performance and responsiveness. 
* Moved Front End Event Submission, Superwidget, Platform Mode,
Posterboard, Stream View, Agenda View, Facebook and Twitter to
extensions. Please view their release notes for details.
* Fixed DST issue causing times to shift one hour.
* Clicking the browser back button returns site visitors to view they
were on.
* Fixed issue where the widget would not display a full day's events.
* Fully hiding password protected events internal description.
* Added improved database migration method which should allow for safe
database schema changes.
* Improved error messages rendering to include more details for
tracing.

= Calendar Features For Users =

This plugin has many features we hope will prove useful to users,
including:

* **Recurring** events.
* **Filtering** by event category or tag.
* Easy **sharing** with Google Calendar, Apple iCal, MS Outlook and
any other system that accepts iCalendar (.ics) feeds.
* Embedded **Google Maps**.
* **Color-coded** events based on category.
* Featured **event images and category images**.
* **Month**, **week**, **day**, **agenda**, and **posterboard**
**views.
* **Upcoming Events** widget.
* Direct links to **filtered calendar views**.
* **Facebook** integration.
* Inline **Calendar Theme editor**.

= Features for Website and Blog Owners =

* Import other calendars automatically to display in your calendar.
* Categorize and tag imported calendar feeds automatically.
* Events from [The Events
Calendar](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/the-events-calendar/).
* Plugin can also be easily imported.

Importing and exporting iCalendar (.ics) feeds is one of the strongest
features of the All-in-One Event Calendar system. Enter an event on
one site and you can have it appear automatically in another website's
calendar. You can even send events from a specific category or tag (or
combination of categories and tags).

Why is this cool? It allows event creators to create one event and
have it displayed on a few or thousands of calendars with no extra
work. And it also allows calendar owners to populate their calendar
from other calendar feeds without having to go through the hassle of
creating new events. For example, a soccer league can send its game
schedule to a community sports calendar, which, in turn, can send only
featured games (from all the sports leagues it aggregates) to a
community calendar, which features sports as just one category.

= Additional Features =

The All-in-One Event Calendar Plugin also has a few features that will
prove useful for website and blog owners:

* Each event is SEO-optimized.
* Each event links to the original calendar.
* Your calendar can be embedded into a WordPress page without needing
to create template files or modify the theme.
